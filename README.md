# No Facebook Emojis

Well, just as many of you, I dislike the new Facebook emojis quite a bit. So I made a browser extension that replaces it with regular old unicode emojis.

# Why?

I think this is clear?

As you can see, from nice emojis, our conversation partner went online, that's a huge improvement!

# Installation

## Safari

1. Download `no-facebook-emoji.safariextz` from the [releases](https://github.com/Haroenv/no-facebook-emojis/releases)
2. Open it in Safari
3. Safari will prompt you to confirm the installation
4. No more ugly emojis!

It will hopefully be available in the Safari Extensions Gallery soon.

## Google Chrome

Soon on the Chrome Web Store, now in the [releases](https://github.com/Haroenv/no-facebook-emojis/releases)

1. Download `chrome.crx` from the [releases](https://github.com/Haroenv/no-facebook-emojis/releases)
1. Go to <chrome://extensions>
1. Drag that file onto your browser and click agree

## Windows

This is mostly tested on OS X because that's what I have and that's the OS that has proper support for unicode emojis. Windows also has support for emojis but they are a single colour and not very pretty.

How to fix this? You can try setting Emoji One or another font as default. Some useful links:
